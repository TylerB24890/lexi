# Lexi Framework v.1.6.0
### This is the pluggable version of Lexi.

## Usage:
* Add the `lexi` directory into your theme directory (preferrably in an `includes` folder of sorts)

* `require_once` (or `include_once`) the Lexi init file (`/lexi/lexi.php`) in your theme's `functions.php` file. See the example below:

  `include_once(get_template_directory() . '/inc/lexi/lexi.php');`

* That's it! You can now begin using Lexi's awesome helper functions, shortcodes and factory in **any** theme you wish.
